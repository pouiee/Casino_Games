# Casino Games

This is a repository of a project near and dear to my heart, card games! I have created working game 
logic for blackjack and war card games complete with AI players. I would like to further refine my 
work in the future as my programming skills get better in the future. I would like to evaluate the 
efficiency of my program as well as analyze data generated in a real way to determine optimal ways 
to play these games. 

Additionally, I would like to use Machine Learning/ Deep Learning algorithms to create better AI 
players in the future but it is not a priority of mine right now. I have included some statistics 
in the main.py file for output win percentages and would love to answer any questions that come up 
at jonathan.jasso5@gmail.com.

Thanks for visiting,

Jonathan Jasso
